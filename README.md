Housing Affordability by Sean Mannisto
This notebook:

- Creates the dataset for my Tableau visualization of housing affordability at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sean.mannisto/viz/HousingPricetoIncomeRatios/Sheet1

- Creates a color and size-coded scatterplot of all US counties and their relative housing affordability

- Calculates a Multiple Linear Regression Model

- Calculates and plots statistics




Note:

- Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code used as county index.
- Some very low population counties have insufficient real estate data, particularly in the western Great Plains
